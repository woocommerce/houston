# Houston
Houston is a child theme for [p2](http://p2theme.com/), designed by the folks at [WooThemes](http://woothemes.com). It features a device-agnostic design so the layout responds to suit the browser, making it easy to stay up to date when you're on the go. Houston also introduces a handy new widget region beanth the post box and features integration with the "p2 likes" plugin.
